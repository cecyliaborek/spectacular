# Spectacular

## A simple testing framework created for fun in Node.js and TypeScript.

This repository is part of a _spectacular_ blogpost series, in which I am sharing my journey of building a testing framework from scratch in TypeScript and Node.js. There are several branches, each corresponding to different part of the project:

- [Part 1.1](cecyliaborek/spectacular/tree/part-1-monorepo-js) - monorepo setup for JavaScript
- [Part 1.2](cecyliaborek/spectacular/tree/part-1-monorepo-js) - monorepo setup for TypeScript
- [Part 2](cecyliaborek/spectacular/tree/part-1-monorepo-js) - core functionalities of a testing framework
