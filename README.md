# Spectacular

## Core testing functionality

**Spectacular** is a simple testing framework created for fun in Node.js and TypeScript.

This branch contains code for the monorepo setup and building the core functionality of the framework (in [packages/core](packages/core)). It is part of my [medium article](https://medium.com/@cecylia.borek/building-a-testing-framework-from-scratch-with-node-js-and-typescript-2709a8041f16).
